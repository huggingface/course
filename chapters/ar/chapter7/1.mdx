In [Chapter 3](/course/chapter3), you saw how to fine-tune a model for text classification. In this chapter, we will tackle the following common NLP tasks:

- Token classification
- Masked language modeling (like BERT)
- Summarization
- Translation
- Causal language modeling pretraining (like GPT-2)
- Question answering

To do this, you'll need to leverage everything you learned about the `Trainer` API and the ðŸ¤— Accelerate library in [Chapter 3](/course/chapter3), the ðŸ¤— Datasets library in [Chapter 5](/course/chapter5), and the ðŸ¤— Tokenizers library in [Chapter 6](/course/chapter6). We'll also upload our results to the Model Hub, like we did in [Chapter 4](/course/chapter4), so this is really the chapter where everything comes together!

Each section can be read independently and will show you how to train a model with the `Trainer` API or with your own training loop, using ðŸ¤— Accelerate. Feel free to skip either part and focus on the one that interests you the most: the `Trainer` API is great for fine-tuning or training your model without worrying about what's going on behind the scenes, while the training loop with `Accelerate` will let you customize any part you want more easily.

<Tip>

If you read the sections in sequence, you will notice that they have quite a bit of code and prose in common. The repetition is intentional, to allow you to dip in (or come back later) to any task that interests you and find a complete working example.
