In [Chapter 2](/course/chapter2) we explored how to use tokenizers and pretrained models to make predictions. But what if you want to fine-tune a pretrained model for your own dataset? That's the topic of this chapter! You will learn:

{#if fw === 'pt'}
* How to prepare a large dataset from the Hub
* How to use the high-level `Trainer` API to fine-tune a model
* How to use a custom training loop
* How to leverage the ðŸ¤— Accelerate library to easily run that custom training loop on any distributed setup

* How to prepare a large dataset from the Hub
* How to use Keras to fine-tune a model
* How to use Keras to get predictions
* How to use a custom metric
