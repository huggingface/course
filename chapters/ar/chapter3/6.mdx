### 1. The `emotion` dataset contains Twitter messages labeled with emotions. Search for it in the [Hub](https://huggingface.co/datasets), and read the dataset card. Which of these is not one of its basic emotions?

<Question
	choices={[
		{
			text: "Joy",
			explain: "Try again â€” this emotion is present in that dataset!"
		},
		{
			text: "Love",
			explain: "Try again â€” this emotion is present in that dataset!"
		},
		{
			text: "Confusion",
			explain: "Correct! Confusion is not one of the six basic emotions.",
            correct: true
		},
        {
			text: "Surprise",
			explain: "Surprise! Try another one!"
		}
	]}
/>

### 2. Search for the `ar_sarcasm` dataset in the [Hub](https://huggingface.co/datasets). Which task does it support?

<Question
	choices={[
		{
			text: "Sentiment classification",
			explain: "That's right! You can tell thanks to the tags.",
            correct: true
		},
		{
			text: "Machine translation",
			explain: "That's not it â€” take another look at the <a href='https://huggingface.co/datasets/ar_sarcasm'>dataset card</a>!"
		},
		{
			text: "Named entity recognition",
			explain: "That's not it â€” take another look at the <a href='https://huggingface.co/datasets/ar_sarcasm'>dataset card</a>!"
		},
        {
			text: "Question answering",
			explain: "Alas, this question was not answered correctly. Try again!"
		}
	]}
/>

### 3. How does the BERT model expect a pair of sentences to be processed?

<Question
	choices={[
		{
			text: "Tokens_of_sentence_1 [SEP] Tokens_of_sentence_2",
			explain: "A <code>[SEP]</code> special token is needed to separate the two sentences, but that's not the only thing!"
		},
		{
			text: "[CLS] Tokens_of_sentence_1 Tokens_of_sentence_2",
			explain: "A <code>[CLS]</code> special token is required at the beginning, but that's not the only thing!"
		},
		{
			text: "[CLS] Tokens_of_sentence_1 [SEP] Tokens_of_sentence_2 [SEP]",
			explain: "That's correct!",
            correct: true
		},
        {
			text: "[CLS] Tokens_of_sentence_1 [SEP] Tokens_of_sentence_2",
			explain: "A <code>[CLS]</code> special token is needed at the beginning as well as a <code>[SEP]</code> special token to separate the two sentences, but that's not all!"
		}
	]}
/>

### 4. What are the benefits of the `Dataset.map()` method?

<Question
	choices={[
		{
			text: "The results of the function are cached, so it won't take any time if we re-execute the code.",
			explain: "That is indeed one of the neat benefits of this method! It's not the only one, though...",
            correct: true
		},
		{
			text: "It can apply multiprocessing to go faster than applying the function on each element of the dataset.",
			explain: "This is a neat feature of this method, but it's not the only one!",
            correct: true
		},
		{
			text: "It does not load the whole dataset into memory, saving the results as soon as one element is processed.",
			explain: "That's one advantage of this method. There are others, though!",
            correct: true
		},
	]}
/>

### 5. What does dynamic padding mean?

<Question
	choices={[
		{
			text: "It's when you pad the inputs for each batch to the maximum length in the whole dataset.",
			explain: "It does imply padding when creating the batch, but not to the maximum length in the whole dataset."
		},
		{
			text: "It's when you pad your inputs when the batch is created, to the maximum length of the sentences inside that batch.",
			explain: "That's correct! The \"dynamic\" part comes from the fact that the size of each batch is determined at the time of creation, and all your batches might have different shapes as a result.",
            correct: true
		},
		{
			text: "It's when you pad your inputs so that each sentence has the same number of tokens as the previous one in the dataset.",
			explain: "That's incorrect, plus it doesn't make sense to look at the order in the dataset since we shuffle it during training."
		},
	]}
/>

### 6. What is the purpose of a collate function?

<Question
	choices={[
		{
			text: "It ensures all the sequences in the dataset have the same length.",
			explain: "A collate function is involved in handling individual batches, not the whole dataset. Additionally, we're talking about generic collate functions, not <code>DataCollatorWithPadding</code> specifically."
		},
		{
			text: "It puts together all the samples in a batch.",
			explain: "Correct! You can pass the collate function as an argument of a <code>DataLoader</code>. We used the <code>DataCollatorWithPadding</code> function, which pads all items in a batch so they have the same length.",
            correct: true
		},
		{
			text: "It preprocesses the whole dataset.",
			explain: "That would be a preprocessing function, not a collate function."
		},
        {
			text: "It truncates the sequences in the dataset.",
			explain: "A collate function is involved in handling individual batches, not the whole dataset. If you're interested in truncating, you can use the <code>truncate</code> argument of <code>tokenizer</code>."
		}
	]}
/>

### 7. What happens when you instantiate one of the `AutoModelForXxx` classes with a pretrained language model (such as `bert-base-uncased`) that corresponds to a different task than the one for which it was trained?

<Question
	choices={[
		{
			text: "Nothing, but you get a warning.",
			explain: "You do get a warning, but that's not all!"
		},
		{
			text: "The head of the pretrained model is discarded and a new head suitable for the task is inserted instead.",
			explain: "Correct. For example, when we used <code>AutoModelForSequenceClassification</code> with <code>bert-base-uncased</code>, we got warnings when instantiating the model. The pretrained head is not used for the sequence classification task, so it's discarded and a new head is instantiated with random weights.",
            correct: true
		},
		{
			text: "The head of the pretrained model is discarded.",
			explain: "Something else needs to happen. Try again!"
		},
        {
			text: "Nothing, since the model can still be fine-tuned for the different task.",
			explain: "The head of the pretrained model was not trained to solve this task, so we should discard the head!"
		}
	]}
/>

### 8. What's the purpose of `TrainingArguments`?

<Question
	choices={[
		{
			text: "It contains all the hyperparameters used for training and evaluation with the <code>Trainer</code>.",
			explain: "Correct!",
            correct: true
		},
		{
			text: "It specifies the size of the model.",
			explain: "The model size is defined by the model configuration, not the class <code>TrainingArguments</code>."
		},
		{
			text: "It just contains the hyperparameters used for evaluation.",
			explain: "In the example, we specified where the model and its checkpoints will be saved. Try again!"
		},
        {
			text: "It just contains the hyperparameters used for training.",
			explain: "In the example, we used an <code>evaluation_strategy</code> as well, so this impacts evaluation. Try again!"
		}
	]}
/>

### 9. Why should you use the ðŸ¤— Accelerate library?

<Question
	choices={[
		{
			text: "It provides access to faster models.",
			explain: "No, the ðŸ¤— Accelerate library does not provide any models."
		},
		{
			text: "It provides a high-level API so I don't have to implement my own training loop.",
			explain: "This is what we did with <code>Trainer</code>, not the ðŸ¤— Accelerate library. Try again!"
		},
		{
			text: "It makes our training loops work on distributed strategies",
			explain: "Correct! With ðŸ¤— Accelerate, your training loops will work for multiple GPUs and TPUs.",
            correct: true
		},
        {
			text: "It provides more optimization functions.",
			explain: "No, the ðŸ¤— Accelerate library does not provide any optimization functions."
		}
	]}
/>

### 4. What happens when you instantiate one of the `TFAutoModelForXxx` classes with a pretrained language model (such as `bert-base-uncased`) that corresponds to a different task than the one for which it was trained?

<Question
	choices={[
		{
			text: "Nothing, but you get a warning.",
			explain: "You do get a warning, but that's not all!"
		},
		{
			text: "The head of the pretrained model is discarded and a new head suitable for the task is inserted instead.",
			explain: "Correct. For example, when we used <code>TFAutoModelForSequenceClassification</code> with <code>bert-base-uncased</code>, we got warnings when instantiating the model. The pretrained head is not used for the sequence classification task, so it's discarded and a new head is instantiated with random weights.",
            correct: true
		},
		{
			text: "The head of the pretrained model is discarded.",
			explain: "Something else needs to happen. Try again!"
		},
        {
			text: "Nothing, since the model can still be fine-tuned for the different task.",
			explain: "The head of the pretrained model was not trained to solve this task, so we should discard the head!"
		}
	]}
/>

### 5. The TensorFlow models from `transformers` are already Keras models. What benefit does this offer?

<Question
	choices={[
		{
			text: "The models work on a TPU out of the box.",
			explain: "Almost! There are some small additional changes required. For example, you need to run everything in a <code>TPUStrategy</code> scope, including the initialization of the model."
		},
		{
			text: "You can leverage existing methods such as <code>compile()</code>, <code>fit()</code>, and <code>predict()</code>.",
			explain: "Correct! Once you have the data, training on it requires very little work.",
            correct: true
		},
		{
			text: "You get to learn Keras as well as transformers.",
			explain: "Correct, but we're looking for something else :)",
			correct: true
		},
        {
			text: "You can easily compute metrics related to the dataset.",
			explain: "Keras helps us with training and evaluating the model, not computing dataset-related metrics."
		}
	]}
/>

### 6. How can you define your own custom metric?

<Question
	choices={[
		{
			text: "By subclassing <code>tf.keras.metrics.Metric</code>.",
			explain: "Great!",
			correct: true
		},
		{
			text: "Using the Keras functional API.",
			explain: "Try again!"
		},
		{
			text: "By using a callable with signature <code>metric_fn(y_true, y_pred)</code>.",
			explain: "Correct!",
			correct: true
		},
        {
			text: "By Googling it.",
			explain: "That's not the answer we're looking for, but it should help you find it.",
			correct: true
		}
	]}
/>
