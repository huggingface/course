Well, that was quite a tour through the ðŸ¤— Datasets library -- congratulations on making it this far! With the knowledge that you've gained from this chapter, you should be able to:

- Load datasets from anywhere, be it the Hugging Face Hub, your laptop, or a remote server at your company.
- Wrangle your data using a mix of the `Dataset.map()` and `Dataset.filter()` functions.
- Quickly switch between data formats like Pandas and NumPy using `Dataset.set_format()`.
- Create your very own dataset and push it to the Hugging Face Hub.
- Embed your documents using a Transformer model and build a semantic search engine using FAISS.

In [Chapter 7](/course/chapter7), we'll put all of this to good use as we take a deep dive into the core NLP tasks that Transformer models are great for. Before jumping ahead, though, put your knowledge of ðŸ¤— Datasets to the test with a quick quiz!
