املای مورد استفاده کلمات فارسی:

|ارائه|

</div>

- * Used in chapter1/page2 to loosely mean 'running' the model.
    If used anywhere else to exact technical meaning we could go
    with 'استنتاج' probably? But that sounds archaic to me.

- Don't translate industry-accepted acronyms. e.g. TPU or GPU.

- Translate acronyms used for convenience in English to full Persian form. e.g. ML

- Keep voice active as consistent. Don't overdo it but try to avoid a passive voice.

- Refer to glossary. Editing is tedious. let's kindly minimize it.

- Keep POV consistent.

- Smaller sentences are better sentences.

- If translating a technical word, keep the choice of Persian equivalent consistent.
   If workspace is mohit-e-kari don't just switch to faza-ye-kari. This ofc
   does not apply for non-technical choices, as in those cases variety actually
   helps keep the text engaging.

- This is merely a translation. Don't add any technical/contextual information
  not present in the original text. Also don't leave stuff out, the creative
  choices in composing this information were the original authors' to make.
  Our creative choices are in doing a quality translation.

- Note on translating indefinite articles(a, an) to Persian. Persian syntax does
  not have these. Common problem in translations is using
  the word 'One'("Yek", "Yeki")"Yek"(One) as a direct word-for-word substitute
  which makes for ugly Persian. Be creative with Persian word order to avoid this.

  For example, the sentence "we use a library" should be translated as
  "ما از کتابخانه‌ای استفاده می‌کنیم" and not "ما از یک کتابخانه استفاده می‌کنیم".
  "Yek" here implies a number(1) to the Persian reader, but the original text
  was emphasizing the indefinite nature of the library and not its count.

- Be exact when choosing equivalents for technical words. Package is package.
  Library is library. Don't mix and match.
