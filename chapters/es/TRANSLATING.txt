1. We use the informal "you" (i.e. "Tu" instead of "Usted") to keep the tone jovial. However, don't use slang or local language.

2. Don't translate industry-accepted acronyms. e.g. TPU or GPU.

3. In certain cases is better to accept an Enlish word. Check for the correct usage of terms in computer science and commonly used terms in other publications.

4. Keep voice active and consistent. Don't overdo it but try to avoid a passive voice.

5. Refer and contribute to the glossary frequently to stay on top of the latest choices we make. This minimizes the amount of editing that is required.

6. Keep POV consistent.

7. Smaller sentences are better sentences. Apply with nuance.

8. If translating a technical word, keep the choice of Spanish translation consistent. This does not apply for non-technical choices, as in those cases variety actually helps keep the text engaging.

9. This is merely a translation. Don't add any technical/contextual information not present in the original text. Also don't leave stuff out. The creative choices in composing this information were the original authors' to make. Our creative choices are in doing a quality translation.

10. Be exact when choosing equivalents for technical words. Package is package. Library is library. Don't mix and match.

11. Library names are kept in the original forms, e.g. "ü§ó Datasets", however, the word dataset in a sentence gets a translation to "Conjunto de datos".

12. As a style choice prefer the imperative over constructions with auxiliary words to avoid unnecessary verbosity and addressing of the reader, which seems unnatural. e.g. "Ver cap√≠tulo X" - "See chapter X" instead of "Puedes ver esto en el cap√≠tulo X" - "You can see this in chapter X".
