# Understanding the Interface class

In this section, we will take a closer look at the `Interface` class, and understand the
main parameters used to create one.

## How to create an Interface

You'll notice that the `Interface` class has 3 required parameters:

`Interface(fn, inputs, outputs, ...)`

These parameters are:

  - `fn`: the prediction function that is wrapped by the Gradio interface. This function can take one or more parameters and return one or more values
  - `inputs`: the input component type(s). Gradio provides many pre-built components such as`"image"` or `"mic"`.
  - `outputs`: the output component type(s). Again, `gradio` provides many pre-built components e.g. `"image"` or `"label"`.

For a complete list of components, [see the Gradio docs ](https://gradio.app/docs). Each pre-built component can be customized by instantiating the class corresponding to the component.

For example, as we saw in the [previous section](/course/chapter9/2),
instead of passing in `"textbox"` to the `inputs` parameter, you can pass in a `Textbox(lines=7, label="Prompt")` component to create a textbox with 7 lines and a label.

Let's take a look at another example, this time with an `Audio` component.

## A simple example with audio

As mentioned earlier, Gradio provides many different inputs and outputs.
So let's build an `Interface` that works with audio.

In this example, we'll build an audio-to-audio function that takes an
audio file and simply reverses it.

We will use for the input the `Audio` component. When using the `Audio` component,
you can specify whether you want the `source` of the audio to be a file that the user
uploads or a microphone that the user records their voice with. In this case, let's
set it to a `"microphone"`. Just for fun, we'll add a label to our `Audio` that says
"Speak here...".

In addition, we'd like to receive the audio as a numpy array so that we can easily
"reverse" it. So we'll set the `"type"` to be `"numpy"`, which passes the input
data as a tuple of (`sample_rate`, `data`) into our function.

We will also use the `Audio` output component which can automatically
render a tuple with a sample rate and numpy array of data as a playable audio file.
In this case, we do not need to do any customization, so we will use the string
shortcut `"audio"`.


```py
import numpy as np
import gradio as gr


def reverse_audio(audio):
    sr, data = audio
    reversed_audio = (sr, np.flipud(data))
    return reversed_audio


mic = gr.Audio(source="microphone", type="numpy", label="Speak here...")
gr.Interface(reverse_audio, mic, "audio").launch()
```

The code above will produce an interface like the one below (if your browser doesn't
ask you for microphone permissions, <a href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/course-demos/audio-reverse" target="_blank">open the demo in  a separate tab</a>.)

You should now be able to record your voice and hear yourself speaking in reverse - spooky 👻!

## Handling multiple inputs and outputs

Let's say we had a more complicated function, with multiple inputs and outputs.
In the example below, we have a function that takes a dropdown index, a slider value, and number,
and returns an audio sample of a musical tone.

Take a look how we pass a list of input and output components,
and see if you can follow along what's happening.

The key here is that when you pass:
* a list of input components, each component corresponds to a parameter in order.
* a list of output coponents, each component corresponds to a returned value.

The code snippet below shows how three input components line up with the three arguments of the `generate_tone()` function:

```py
import numpy as np
import gradio as gr

notes = ["C", "C#", "D", "D#", "E", "F", "F#", "G", "G#", "A", "A#", "B"]


def generate_tone(note, octave, duration):
    sr = 48000
    a4_freq, tones_from_a4 = 440, 12 * (octave - 4) + (note - 9)
    frequency = a4_freq * 2 ** (tones_from_a4 / 12)
    duration = int(duration)
    audio = np.linspace(0, duration, duration * sr)
    audio = (20000 * np.sin(audio * (2 * np.pi * frequency))).astype(np.int16)
    return (sr, audio)


gr.Interface(
    generate_tone,
    [
        gr.Dropdown(notes, type="index"),
        gr.Slider(minimum=4, maximum=6, step=1),
        gr.Textbox(type="number", value=1, label="Duration in seconds"),
    ],
    "audio",
).launch()
```

### The `launch()` method

So far, we have used the `launch()` method to launch the interface, but we
haven't really discussed what it does.

By default, the `launch()` method will launch the demo in a web server that
is running locally. If you are running your code in a Jupyter or Colab notebook, then
Gradio will embed the demo GUI in the notebook so you can easily use it.

You can customize the behavior of `launch()` through different parameters:

  - `inline` - whether to display the interface inline on Python notebooks.
  - `inbrowser` - whether to automatically launch the interface in a new tab on the default browser.
  - `share` - whether to create a publicly shareable link from your computer for the interface. Kind of like a Google Drive link!

We'll cover the `share` parameter in a lot more detail in the next section!

## ✏️ Let's apply it!

Let's build an interface that allows you to demo a **speech-recognition** model.
To make it interesting, we will accept *either* a mic input or an uploaded file.

As usual, we'll load our speech recognition model using the `pipeline()` function from 🤗 Transformers.
If you need a quick refresher, you can go back to [that section in Chapter 1](/course/chapter1/3).   Next, we'll implement a `transcribe_audio()` function that processes the audio and returns the transcription. Finally, we'll wrap this function in an `Interface` with the `Audio` components for the inputs and just text for the output. Altogether, the code for this application is the following:

```py
from transformers import pipeline
import gradio as gr

model = pipeline("automatic-speech-recognition")


def transcribe_audio(mic=None, file=None):
    if mic is not None:
        audio = mic
    elif file is not None:
        audio = file
    else:
        return "You must either provide a mic recording or a file"
    transcription = model(audio)["text"]
    return transcription


gr.Interface(
    fn=transcribe_audio,
    inputs=[
        gr.Audio(source="microphone", type="filepath", optional=True),
        gr.Audio(source="upload", type="filepath", optional=True),
    ],
    outputs="text",
).launch()
```

If your browser doesn't ask you for microphone permissions, <a href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/course-demos/audio-reverse" target="_blank">open the demo in a separate tab</a>.

<iframe src="https://hf.space/gradioiframe/course-demos/asr/+" frameBorder="0" height="550" title="Gradio app" class="container p-0 flex-grow space-iframe" allow="accelerometer; ambient-light-sensor; autoplay; battery; camera; document-domain; encrypted-media; fullscreen; geolocation; gyroscope; layout-animations; legacy-image-formats; magnetometer; microphone; midi; oversized-images; payment; picture-in-picture; publickey-credentials-get; sync-xhr; usb; vr ; wake-lock; xr-spatial-tracking" sandbox="allow-forms allow-modals allow-popups allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-downloads"></iframe>


That's it! You can now use this interface to transcribe audio. Notice here that
by passing in the `optional` parameter as `True`, we allow the user to either
provide a microphone or an audio file (or neither, but that will return an error message).

Keep going to see how to share your interface with others!
