# Gradio, check!

This wraps up the chapter on building cool ML demos with Gradio - we hope you enjoyed it! To recap, in this chapter we learned:

- How to create Gradio demos with the high-level `Interface` API, and how to configure different input and output modalities.
- Different ways to share Gradio demos, through temporary links and hosting on [Hugging Face Spaces](https://huggingface.co/spaces).
- How to integrate Gradio demos with models and Spaces on the Hugging Face Hub.
- Advanced features like storing state in a demo or providing authentication.
- How to have full control of the data flow and layout of your demo with Gradio Blocks.
