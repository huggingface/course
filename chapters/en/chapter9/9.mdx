            correct: true
		},

			correct: true
		},

### 5. Which of the following features are supported by Gradio?

<Question
	choices={[

        },
        {
			text: "Loading a model from Hugging Face's model hub or Hugging Face Spaces",
			explain: "Absolutely - load any Hugging Face model using the <code>gr.Interface.load()</code> method",
			correct: true
        }
	]}
/>

### 6. Which of the following are valid ways of loading a Hugging Face model from Hub or Spaces?

<Question
	choices={[

            correct: true
        },
        {
			text: "gr.Interface.load('model/{user}/{model_name}')",

			correct: true
        },
        {
			text: "gr.Interface.load('demos/{user}/{model_name}')",
			explain: "Try again -- you cannot load a model by using the 'demos' prefix."
        },
        {
			text: "gr.Interface.load('spaces/{user}/{model_name}')",

			correct: true
        },
        {
			text: "Automatically determine which `Blocks` component should be interactive vs. static",
			explain: "Based on the event triggers you define, `Blocks` automatically figures out whether a component should accept user input or not.",
			correct: true
        },
		 {
			text: "Create multi-step demos; meaning allowing you to reuse the output of one component as the input to the next",
			explain: "You can use a component for the input of one event trigger but the output of another.",

        },
	]}
/>
