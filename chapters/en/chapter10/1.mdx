So far in this course, we've seen that Transformers are exceptionally good at tackling a wide variety of tasks in NLP. But did you know that Transformers can also be applied to entirely different _modalities_ like audio and images? In this chapter, we will explore how Transformers can process _audio waveforms_ to produce novel applications like speech recognition and music generation.

After explaining how the Transformer architecture can be applied to audio and speech processing, each of the sections in this chapter will dive into some of the most common tasks in this fast-moving field:

* Classifying audio signals into a set of categories.
* Transcribing speech to text
* Converting text to speech
* Bypassing text altogether and converting audio to audio

To do this, you'll need to leverage everything you learned about the `Trainer` API library in [Chapter 3](/course/chapter3), the 🤗 Datasets library in [Chapter 5](/course/chapter5), and the Gradio library in [Chapter 9](/course/chapter9). So go read those chapters first if you haven't done so already.

Let's now dive into the fascinating world of audio!
