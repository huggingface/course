# Use your annotated dataset

We will learn now how to export and use the annotated data that we have in Argilla. 

## Load the dataset

First, we'll need to make sure that we're connected to our Argilla instance as in the previous steps:

```python
import argilla as rg

HF_TOKEN = "..." # only for private spaces

client = rg.Argilla(
    api_url="...",
    api_key="...",
    headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {HF_TOKEN}"} # only for private spaces
)
```

And now, we'll load the dataset that we'll be working with:

```python
dataset = client.datasets(name="ag_news")
```

Loading the dataset and calling its records with `dataset.records` is enough to start using your dataset and records for your own purposes and pipelines. However, we'll also learn how to do a few optional operations, like filtering the records and exporting your dataset to the Hugging Face Hub.

## Filter the dataset

Sometimes you only want to use the records that have been completed, so we will first filter the records in our dataset based on their status:

```python
status_filter = rg.Query(
    filter=rg.Filter(
        [
            ("status", "==", "completed")
        ]
    )
)

filtered_records = dataset.records(status_filter)
```

<Tip>
⚠️ Note that the records could have more than one response and that each of them can have any status from `submitted`, `draft` or `discarded`.
</Tip>

Learn more about querying and filtering records in the [Argilla docs](https://docs.argilla.io/latest/how_to_guides/query/).

## Export to the Hub

We can now export our records to a Dataset in the Hugging Face Hub, so we can share our annotations with others. To do this, we'll need to convert the records into a Dataset and then push it to the Hub:

```python
filtered_records.to_datasets().push_to_hub("argilla/ag_news_annotated")
```

Alternatively, we can export directly the complete Argilla dataset (including pending records) like this:

```python
dataset.to_hub(repo_id="argilla/ag_news_annotated")
```

This is an interesting choice in case others want to open the dataset in their Argilla instances, as the settings are automatically saved and they can simply import the full dataset using a single line of code:

```python
dataset = rg.Dataset.from_hub(repo_id="argilla/ag_news_annotated")
```
