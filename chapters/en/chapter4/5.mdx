Congratulations on finishing the first part of this course! To recap, in this chapter you:

* Learned how to navigate the HuggingFace Hub.
* Compared importing a pretrained model from the pipeline(), directly from the model architecture, and the [Auto* classes](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/auto?highlight=auto#auto-classes).
* Learned the different methods of sharing models.
* Learned the basic structure and importance of the model card.

You should now be able to fine-tune a pretrained model on a text classification problem (single or pairs of sentences) and upload the result to the Model Hub. To demonstrate mastery in this first section, try to do this for a problem and language that interests you! You can find help in the [Hugging Face forums](https://discuss.huggingface.co/) and share your project in [this topic](https://discuss.huggingface.co/t/share-your-projects/6803) once you're finished.

We can't wait to see what you will build with this!
