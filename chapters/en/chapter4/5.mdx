This is the end of the first part of the course! Part 2 will be released on November 15th with a big community event, see more information [here](https://huggingface.co/blog/course-launch-event).

You should now be able to fine-tune a pretrained model on a text classification problem (single or pairs of sentences) and upload the result to the Model Hub. To make sure you mastered this first section, you should do exactly that on a problem that interests you (and not necessarily in English if you speak another language)! You can find help in the [Hugging Face forums](https://discuss.huggingface.co/) and share your project in [this topic](https://discuss.huggingface.co/t/share-your-projects/6803) once you're finished.

We can't wait to see what you will build with this!
