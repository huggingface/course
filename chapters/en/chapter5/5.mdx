Sometimes the dataset that you need to build an NLP application doesn't exist, so you'll need to create it yourself. In this section we'll show you how to create a corpus of [GitHub issues](https://github.com/features/issues/), which are commonly used to track bugs or features in GitHub repositories. This corpus could be used for various purposes, including:

* Exploring how long it takes to close open issues or pull requests
* Training a _multilabel classifier_ that can tag issues with metadata based on the issue's description (e.g., "bug," "enhancement," or "question")
* Creating a semantic search engine to find which issues match a user's query

Here we'll focus on creating the corpus, and in the next section we'll tackle the semantic search application. To keep things meta, we'll use the GitHub issues associated with a popular open source project: 🤗 Datasets! Let's take a look at how to get the data and explore the information contained in these issues.

## Getting the data

You can find all the issues in 🤗 Datasets by navigating to the repository's [Issues tab](https://github.com/huggingface/datasets/issues). As shown in the following screenshot, at the time of writing there were 331 open issues and 668 closed ones.

<div class="flex justify-center">
<img src="https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface-course/documentation-images/resolve/main/en/chapter5/datasets-issues.png" alt="The GitHub issues associated with 🤗 Datasets." width="80%"/>
</div>

If you click on one of these issues you'll find it contains a title, a description, and a set of labels that characterize the issue. An example is shown in the screenshot below.

<div class="flex justify-center">
<img src="https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface-course/documentation-images/resolve/main/en/chapter5/datasets-issues-single.png" alt="A typical GitHub issue in the 🤗 Datasets repository." width="80%"/>
</div>

To download all the repository's issues, we'll use the [GitHub REST API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest) to poll the [`Issues` endpoint](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/reference/issues#list-repository-issues). This endpoint returns a list of JSON objects, with each object containing a large number of fields that include the title and description as well as metadata about the status of the issue and so on.

A convenient way to download the issues is via the `requests` library, which is the standard way for making HTTP requests in Python. You can install the library by running:

```python
!pip install requests
```

Once the library is installed, you can make GET requests to the `Issues` endpoint by invoking the `requests.get()` function. For example, you can run the following command to retrieve the first issue on the first page:

```py
import requests

url = "https://api.github.com/repos/huggingface/datasets/issues?page=1&per_page=1"
response = requests.get(url)
```

The `response` object contains a lot of useful information about the request, including the HTTP status code:

```py
response.status_code
```

```python out
200
```

where a `200` status means the request was successful (you can find a list of possible HTTP status codes [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes)). What we are really interested in, though, is the _payload_, which can be accessed in various formats like bytes, strings, or JSON. Since we know our issues are in JSON format, let's inspect the payload as follows:

```py
response.json()
```

```python out

```

Whoa, that's a lot of information! We can see useful fields like `title`, `body`, and `number` that describe the issue, as well as information about the GitHub user who opened the issue.

<Tip>

✏️ **Try it out!** Click on a few of the URLs in the JSON payload above to get a feel for what type of information each GitHub issue is linked to.

</Tip>

As described in the GitHub [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/overview/resources-in-the-rest-api#rate-limiting), unauthenticated requests are limited to 60 requests per hour. Although you can increase the `per_page` query parameter to reduce the number of requests you make, you will still hit the rate limit on any repository that has more than a few thousand issues. So instead, you should follow GitHub's [instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token) on creating a _personal access token_ so that you can boost the rate limit to 5,000 requests per hour. Once you have your token, you can include it as part of the request header:

```py
GITHUB_TOKEN = xxx  # Copy your GitHub token here
headers = {"Authorization": f"token {GITHUB_TOKEN}"}
```

<Tip warning={true}>

⚠️ Do not share a notebook with your `GITHUB_TOKEN` pasted in it. We recommend you delete the last cell once you have executed it to avoid leaking this information accidentally. Even better, store the token in a *.env* file and use the [`python-dotenv` library](https://github.com/theskumar/python-dotenv) to load it automatically for you as an environment variable.

</Tip>

Now that we have our access token, let's create a function that can download all the issues from a GitHub repository:

```py
import time
import math
from pathlib import Path
import pandas as pd
from tqdm.notebook import tqdm


def fetch_issues(
    owner="huggingface",
    repo="datasets",
    num_issues=10_000,
    rate_limit=5_000,
    issues_path=Path("."),
):
    if not issues_path.is_dir():
        issues_path.mkdir(exist_ok=True)

    batch = []
    all_issues = []
    per_page = 100  # Number of issues to return per page
    num_pages = math.ceil(num_issues / per_page)
    base_url = "https://api.github.com/repos"

    for page in tqdm(range(num_pages)):
        # Query with state=all to get both open and closed issues
        query = f"issues?page={page}&per_page={per_page}&state=all"
        issues = requests.get(f"{base_url}/{owner}/{repo}/{query}", headers=headers)
        batch.extend(issues.json())

        if len(batch) > rate_limit and len(all_issues) < num_issues:
            all_issues.extend(batch)
            batch = []  # Flush batch for next time period
            print(f"Reached GitHub rate limit. Sleeping for one hour ...")
            time.sleep(60 * 60 + 1)

    all_issues.extend(batch)
    df = pd.DataFrame.from_records(all_issues)
    df.to_json(f"{issues_path}/{repo}-issues.jsonl", orient="records", lines=True)
    print(
        f"Downloaded all the issues for {repo}! Dataset stored at {issues_path}/{repo}-issues.jsonl"
    )
```

Now when we call `fetch_issues()` it will download all the issues in batches to avoid exceeding GitHub's limit on the number of requests per hour; the result will be stored in a _repository_name-issues.jsonl_ file, where each line is a JSON object the represents an issue. Let's use this function to grab all the issues from 🤗 Datasets:

```py
# Depending on your internet connection, this can take several minutes to run...
fetch_issues()
```

Once the issues are downloaded we can load them locally using our newfound skills from [section 2](/course/chaper5/2):

```py
issues_dataset = load_dataset("json", data_files="datasets-issues.jsonl", split="train")
issues_dataset
```

```python out
Dataset({
    features: ['url', 'repository_url', 'labels_url', 'comments_url', 'events_url', 'html_url', 'id', 'node_id', 'number', 'title', 'user', 'labels', 'state', 'locked', 'assignee', 'assignees', 'milestone', 'comments', 'created_at', 'updated_at', 'closed_at', 'author_association', 'active_lock_reason', 'pull_request', 'body', 'timeline_url', 'performed_via_github_app'],
    num_rows: 3019
})
```

Great, we've created our first dataset from scratch! But why are there several thousand issues when the [Issues tab](https://github.com/huggingface/datasets/issues) of the 🤗 Datasets repository only shows around 1,000 issues in total 🤔? As described in the GitHub [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/reference/issues#list-issues-assigned-to-the-authenticated-user), that's because we've downloaded all the pull requests as well:

> GitHub's REST API v3 considers every pull request an issue, but not every issue is a pull request. For this reason, "Issues" endpoints may return both issues and pull requests in the response. You can identify pull requests by the `pull_request` key. Be aware that the `id` of a pull request returned from "Issues" endpoints will be an issue id.

Since the contents of issues and pull requests are quite different, let's do some minor preprocessing to enable us to distinguish between them.

## Cleaning up the data

The above snippet from GitHub's documentation tells us that the `pull_request` column can be used to differentiate between issues and pull requests. Let's look at a random sample to see what the difference is. As we did in [section 3](/course/chapter5/3), we'll chain `Dataset.shuffle()` and `Dataset.select()` to create a random sample and then zip the `html_url` and `pull_request` columns so we can compare the various URLs:

```py
sample = issues_dataset.shuffle(seed=666).select(range(3))

# Print out the URL and pull request entries
for url, pr in zip(sample["html_url"], sample["pull_request"]):
    print(f">> URL: {url}")
    print(f">> Pull request: {pr}\n")
```

```python out
>> URL: https://github.com/huggingface/datasets/pull/850
>> Pull request: {'url': 'https://api.github.com/repos/huggingface/datasets/pulls/850', 'html_url': 'https://github.com/huggingface/datasets/pull/850', 'diff_url': 'https://github.com/huggingface/datasets/pull/850.diff', 'patch_url': 'https://github.com/huggingface/datasets/pull/850.patch'}

>> URL: https://github.com/huggingface/datasets/issues/2773
>> Pull request: None

>> URL: https://github.com/huggingface/datasets/pull/783
>> Pull request: {'url': 'https://api.github.com/repos/huggingface/datasets/pulls/783', 'html_url': 'https://github.com/huggingface/datasets/pull/783', 'diff_url': 'https://github.com/huggingface/datasets/pull/783.diff', 'patch_url': 'https://github.com/huggingface/datasets/pull/783.patch'}
```

Here we can see that each pull request is associated with various URLs, while ordinary issues have a `None` entry. We can use this distinction to create a new `is_pull_request` column that checks whether the `pull_request` field is `None` or not:

```py
issues_dataset = issues_dataset.map(
    lambda x: {"is_pull_request": False if x["pull_request"] is None else True}
)
```

<Tip>

✏️ **Try it out!** Calculate the average time it takes to close issues in 🤗 Datasets. You may find the `Dataset.filter()` function useful to filter out the pull requests and open issues, and you can use the `Dataset.set_format()` function to convert the dataset to a `DataFrame` so you can easily manipulate the `created_at` and `closed_at` timestamps. For bonus points, calculate the average time it takes to close pull requests.

</Tip>

Although we could proceed to further clean up the dataset by dropping or renaming some columns, it is generally a good practice to keep the dataset as "raw" as possible at this stage so that it can be easily used in multiple applications.

Before we push our dataset to the Hugging Face Hub, let's deal with one thing that's missing from it: the comments associated with each issue and pull request. We'll add them next with -- you guessed it -- the GitHub REST API!

## Augmenting the dataset

As shown in the following screenshot, the comments associated with an issue or pull request provide a rich source of information, especially if we're interested in building a search engine to answer user queries about the library.

<div class="flex justify-center">
<img src="https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface-course/documentation-images/resolve/main/en/chapter5/datasets-issues-comment.png" alt="Comments associated with an issue about 🤗 Datasets." width="80%"/>
</div>

The GitHub REST API provides a [`Comments` endpoint](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/reference/issues#list-issue-comments) that returns all the comments associated with an issue number. Let's test the endpoint to see what it returns:

```py
issue_number = 2792
url = f"https://api.github.com/repos/huggingface/datasets/issues/{issue_number}/comments"
response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)
response.json()
```

```python out

Any suggestions on how can I avoid this error?",
  'performed_via_github_app': None}]
```

We can see that the comment is stored in the `body` field, so let's write a simple function that returns all the comments associated with an issue by picking out the `body` contents for each element in `response.json()`:

```py
def get_comments(issue_number):
    url = f"https://api.github.com/repos/huggingface/datasets/issues/{issue_number}/comments"
    response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)
    return [r["body"] for r in response.json()]


# Test our function works as expected
get_comments(2792)
```

```python out
["@albertvillanova my tests are failing here:\r\n```\r\ndataset_name = 'gooaq'\r\n\r\n    def test_load_dataset(self, dataset_name):\r\n        configs = self.dataset_tester.load_all_configs(dataset_name, is_local=True)[:1]\r\n>       self.dataset_tester.check_load_dataset(dataset_name, configs, is_local=True, use_local_dummy_data=True)\r\n\r\ntests/test_dataset_common.py:234: \r\n_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ \r\ntests/test_dataset_common.py:187: in check_load_dataset\r\n    self.parent.assertTrue(len(dataset[split]) > 0)\r\nE   AssertionError: False is not true\r\n```\r\nWhen I try loading dataset on local machine it works fine. Any suggestions on how can I avoid this error?"]
```

This looks good, so let's use `Dataset.map()` to add a new `comments` column to each issue in our dataset:

```py
# Depending on your internet connection, this can take a few minutes...
issues_with_comments_dataset = issues_dataset.map(
    lambda x: {"comments": get_comments(x["number"])}
)
```

The final step is to save the augmented dataset alongside our raw data so we can push them both to the Hub:

```py
issues_with_comments_dataset.to_json("issues-datasets-with-comments.jsonl")
```

## Uploading the dataset to the Hugging Face Hub

<Youtube id="HaN6qCr_Afc"/>

Now that we have our augmented dataset, it's time to push it to the Hub so we can share it with the community! To upload the dataset we'll use the [🤗 Hub library](https://github.com/huggingface/huggingface_hub), which allows us to interact with the Hugging Face Hub through a Python API. 🤗 Hub comes preinstalled with 🤗 Transformers, so we can use it directly. For example, we can use the `list_datasets()` function to get information about all the public datasets currently hosted on the Hub:

```py
from huggingface_hub import list_datasets

all_datasets = list_datasets()
print(f"Number of datasets on Hub: {len(all_datasets)}")
print(all_datasets[0])
```

```python out
Number of datasets on Hub: 1487
Dataset Name: acronym_identification, Tags: ['annotations_creators:expert-generated', 'language_creators:found', 'languages:en', 'licenses:mit', 'multilinguality:monolingual', 'size_categories:10K<n<100K', 'source_datasets:original', 'task_categories:structure-prediction', 'task_ids:structure-prediction-other-acronym-identification']
```

We can see that there are currently nearly 1,500 datasets on the Hub, and the `list_datasets()` function also provides some basic metadata about each dataset repository.

For our purposes, the first thing we need to do is create a new dataset repository on the Hub. To do that we need an authentication token, which can be obtained by first logging into the Hugging Face Hub with the `notebook_login()` function:

```py
from huggingface_hub import notebook_login

notebook_login()
```

This will create a widget where you can enter your username and password, and an API token will be saved in *~/.huggingface/token*. If you're running the code in a terminal, you can log in via the CLI instead:

```bash
huggingface-cli login
```

Once we've done this, we can create a new dataset repository with the `create_repo()` function:

```py
from huggingface_hub import create_repo

repo_url = create_repo(name="github-issues", repo_type="dataset")
repo_url
```

```python out
'https://huggingface.co/datasets/lewtun/github-issues'
```

In this example, we've created an empty dataset repository called `github-issues` under the `lewtun` username (the username should be your Hub username when you're running this code!).

<Tip>

✏️ **Try it out!** Use your Hugging Face Hub username and password to obtain a token and create an empty repository called `github-issues`. Remember to **never save your credentials** in Colab or any other repository, as this information can be exploited by bad actors.

</Tip>

Next, let's clone the repository from the Hub to our local machine and copy our dataset file into it. 🤗 Hub provides a handy `Repository` class that wraps many of the common Git commands, so to clone the remote repository we simply need to provide the URL and local path we wish to clone to:

```py
from huggingface_hub import Repository

repo = Repository(local_dir="github-issues", clone_from=repo_url)
!cp issues-datasets-with-comments.jsonl github-issues/
```

By default, various file extensions (such as *.bin*, *.gz*, and *.zip*) are tracked with Git LFS so that large files can be versioned within the same Git workflow. You can find a list of tracked file extensions inside the repository's *.gitattributes* file. To include the JSON Lines format in the list, we can run the following command:

```py
repo.lfs_track("*.jsonl")
```

Then we can use `Repository.push_to_hub()` to push the dataset to the Hub:

```py
repo.push_to_hub()
```

If we navigate to the URL contained in `repo_url`, we should now see that our dataset file has been uploaded.

<div class="flex justify-center">
<img src="https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface-course/documentation-images/resolve/main/en/chapter5/hub-repo.png" alt="Our dataset repository on the Hugging Face Hub." width="80%"/>
</div>

From here, anyone can download the dataset by simply providing `load_dataset()` with the repository ID as the `path` argument:

```py
remote_dataset = load_dataset("lewtun/github-issues", split="train")
remote_dataset
```

```python out
Dataset({
    features: ['url', 'repository_url', 'labels_url', 'comments_url', 'events_url', 'html_url', 'id', 'node_id', 'number', 'title', 'user', 'labels', 'state', 'locked', 'assignee', 'assignees', 'milestone', 'comments', 'created_at', 'updated_at', 'closed_at', 'author_association', 'active_lock_reason', 'pull_request', 'body', 'performed_via_github_app', 'is_pull_request'],
    num_rows: 2855
})
```

Cool, we've pushed our dataset to the Hub and it's available for others to use! There's just one important thing left to do: adding a _dataset card_ that explains how the corpus was created and provides other useful information for the community.

<Tip>

💡 You can also upload a dataset to the Hugging Face Hub directly from the terminal by using `huggingface-cli` and a bit of Git magic. See the [🤗 Datasets guide](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/share.html#add-a-community-dataset) for details on how to do this.

</Tip>

## Creating a dataset card

Well-documented datasets are more likely to be useful to others (including your future self!), as they provide the context to enable users to decide whether the dataset is relevant to their task and to evaluate any potential biases in or risks associated with using the dataset.

On the Hugging Face Hub, this information is stored in each dataset repository's *README.md* file. There are two main steps you should take before creating this file:

1. Use the [`datasets-tagging` application](https://huggingface.co/datasets/tagging/) to create metadata tags in YAML format. These tags are used for a variety of search features on the Hugging Face Hub and ensure your dataset can be easily found by members of the community. Since we have created a custom dataset here, you'll need to clone the `datasets-tagging` repository and run the application locally. Here's what the interface looks like:

<div class="flex justify-center">
<img src="https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface-course/documentation-images/resolve/main/en/chapter5/datasets-tagger.png" alt="The `datasets-tagging` interface." width="80%"/>

2. Read the [🤗 Datasets guide](https://github.com/huggingface/datasets/blob/master/templates/README_guide.md) on creating informative dataset cards and use it as a template.

You can create the *README.md* file directly on the Hub, and you can find a template dataset card in the `lewtun/github-issues` dataset repository. A screenshot of the filled-out dataset card is shown below.

<Tip>

✏️ **Try it out!** Use the `dataset-tagging` application and [🤗 Datasets guide](https://github.com/huggingface/datasets/blob/master/templates/README_guide.md) to complete the *README.md* file for your GitHub issues dataset.

</Tip>

That's it! We've seen in this section that creating a good dataset can be quite involved, but fortunately uploading it and sharing it with the community is not. In the next section we'll use our new dataset to create a semantic search engine with 🤗 Datasets that can match questions to the most relevant issues and comments.

<Tip>

✏️ **Try it out!** Go through the steps we took in this section to create a dataset of GitHub issues for your favorite open source library (pick something other than 🤗 Datasets, of course!). For bonus points, fine-tune a multilabel classifier to predict the tags present in the `labels` field.
