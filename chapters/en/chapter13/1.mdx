# Open R1 for Students

Welcome to an exciting journey into the world of open-source AI with reinforcement learning! This chapter is designed to help students understand reinforcement learning and its role in LLMs.

We will also explore Open R1, a groundbreaking community project that's making advanced AI accessible to everyone. Specifically, this course is to help students and learners to use and contribute to Open R1.

## What You'll Learn

In this chapter, we'll break down complex concepts into easy-to-understand pieces and show you how you can be part of this exciting project. Whether you're new to AI or have some experience, you'll find something valuable here.

## Why This Matters for Students

As a student, understanding Open R1 and the role of reinforcement learning in LLMs is valuable because:
- It shows you how cutting-edge AI is developed
- It gives you hands-on opportunities to learn and contribute
- It helps you understand where AI technology is heading
- It opens doors to future career opportunities in AI

## Chapter Overview

This chapter is divided into four sections, each focusing on a different aspect of Open R1:

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Introduction to Reinforcement Learning and its Role in LLMs
We'll explore the basics of Reinforcement Learning (RL) and its role in training LLMs.
- What is RL?
- How is RL used in LLMs?
- What is DeepSeek R1?
- What are the key innovations of DeepSeek R1?

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Understanding the DeepSeek R1 Paper
We'll break down the research paper that inspired Open R1:
- Key innovations and breakthroughs
- The training process and architecture
- Results and their significance

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Implementing GRPO in TRL
We'll get practical with code examples:
- How to use the Transformer Reinforcement Learning (TRL) library
- Setting up GRPO training

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Practical use case to align a model
We'll look at a practical use case to align a model using Open R1.
- How to train a model using GRPO in TRL
