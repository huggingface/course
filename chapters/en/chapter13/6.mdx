# Length Reward Function Interactive Demo

export const MdxNotebook = (props) => {
  return (

The Marimo notebook below allows you to:
1. Adjust the ideal length using a slider
2. See how different completions would be scored
3. Visualize the reward curve

    **How it works:**
    - Reward = -|ideal_length - actual_length|
    - Higher reward (closer to 0) is better
    - Current ideal length: {ideal_length.value} characters
