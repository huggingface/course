# Decoder models

<Youtube id="d_ixlCubqQw" />

Decoder models use only the decoder of a Transformer model. At each stage, for a given word the attention layers can only access the words positioned before it in the sentence. These models are often called *auto-regressive models*.

The pretraining of decoder models usually revolves around predicting the next word in the sentence.

These models are best suited for tasks involving text generation.
