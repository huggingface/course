# Introduction

## Welcome to the ðŸ¤— Course!

<Youtube id="00GKzGyWFEs" />

This course will teach you about natural language processing (NLP) using libraries from the [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/) ecosystem â€” [ðŸ¤— Transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers), [ðŸ¤— Datasets](https://github.com/huggingface/datasets), [ðŸ¤— Tokenizers](https://github.com/huggingface/tokenizers), and [ðŸ¤— Accelerate](https://github.com/huggingface/accelerate) â€” as well as the [Hugging Face Hub](https://huggingface.co/models). It's completely free and without ads.


## What to expect?

Here is a brief overview of the course:

- Chapters 1 to 4 provide an introduction to the main concepts of the ðŸ¤— Transformers library. By the end of this part of the course, you will be familiar with how Transformer models work and will know how to use a model from the [Hugging Face Hub](https://huggingface.co/models), fine-tune it on a dataset, and share your results on the Hub!
- Chapters 5 to 8 teach the basics of ðŸ¤— Datasets and ðŸ¤— Tokenizers before diving into classic NLP tasks. By the end of this part, you will be able to tackle the most common NLP problems by yourself.
- Chapters 9 to 12 go beyond NLP, and explore how Transformer models can be used tackle tasks in speech processing and computer vision. Along the way, you'll learn how to build and share demos of your models, and optimize them for production environments. By the end of this part, you will be ready to apply ðŸ¤— Transformers to (almost) any machine learning problem!

This course:

* Requires a good knowledge of Python
* Is better taken after an introductory deep learning course, such as [fast.ai's](https://www.fast.ai/) [Practical Deep Learning for Coders](https://course.fast.ai/) or one of the programs developed by [DeepLearning.AI](https://www.deeplearning.ai/)
* Does not expect prior [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) or [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) knowledge, though some familiarity with either of those will help

After you've completed this course, we recommend checking out DeepLearning.AI's [Natural Language Processing Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/natural-language-processing?utm_source=deeplearning-ai&utm_medium=institutions&utm_campaign=20211011-nlp-2-hugging_face-page-nlp-refresh), which covers a wide range of traditional NLP models like naive Bayes and LSTMs that are well worth knowing about!

## Who are we?

About the authors:

**Abubakar Abid** completed his PhD at Stanford in applied machine learning. During his PhD, he founded [Gradio](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio), an open-source Python library that has been used to build over 600,000 machine learning demos. Gradio was acquired by Hugging Face, which is where Abubakar now serves as a machine learning team lead.

**Matthew Carrigan** is a Machine Learning Engineer at Hugging Face. He lives in Dublin, Ireland and previously worked as an ML engineer at Parse.ly and before that as a post-doctoral researcher at Trinity College Dublin. He does not believe we're going to get to AGI by scaling existing architectures, but has high hopes for robot immortality regardless.

**Lysandre Debut** is a Machine Learning Engineer at Hugging Face and has been working on the ðŸ¤— Transformers library since the very early development stages. His aim is to make NLP accessible for everyone by developing tools with a very simple API.

**Sylvain Gugger** is a Research Engineer at Hugging Face and one of the core maintainers of the ðŸ¤— Transformers library. Previously he was a Research Scientist at fast.ai, and he co-wrote _[Deep Learning for Coders with fastai and PyTorch](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/deep-learning-for/9781492045519/)_ with Jeremy Howard. The main focus of his research is on making deep learning more accessible, by designing and improving techniques that allow models to train fast on limited resources.

**Dawood Khan** is a Machine Learning Engineer at Hugging Face. He's from NYC and graduated from New York University studying Computer Science. After working as an iOS Engineer for a few years, Dawood quit to start Gradio with his fellow co-founders. Gradio was eventually acquired by Hugging Face.

**Merve Noyan** is a developer advocate at Hugging Face, working on developing tools and building content around them to democratize machine learning for everyone.

**Lucile Saulnier** is a machine learning engineer at Hugging Face, developing and supporting the use of open source tools. She is also actively involved in many research projects in the field of Natural Language Processing such as collaborative training and BigScience.

**Lewis Tunstall**  is a machine learning engineer at Hugging Face, focused on developing open-source tools and making them accessible to the wider community. He is also a co-author of the Oâ€™Reilly book [Natural Language Processing with Transformers](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/natural-language-processing/9781098103231/).

**Leandro von Werra**  is a machine learning engineer in the open-source team at Hugging Face and also a co-author of the Oâ€™Reilly book [Natural Language Processing with Transformers](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/natural-language-processing/9781098103231/). He has several years of industry experience bringing NLP projects to production by working across the whole machine learning stack..

Are you ready to roll? In this chapter, you will learn:
* How to use the `pipeline()` function to solve NLP tasks such as text generation and classification
* About the Transformer architecture
* How to distinguish between encoder, decoder, and encoder-decoder architectures and use cases
