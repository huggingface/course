Congratulations, you've made it through the second part of the course! We're actively working on the third one, so subscribe to our [newsletter](https://huggingface.curated.co/) to make sure you don't miss its release.

You should now be able to tackle a range of NLP tasks, and fine-tune or pretrain a model on them. Don't forget to share your results with the community on the [Model Hub](https://huggingface.co/models).

We can't wait to see what you will build with the knowledge that you've gained!
