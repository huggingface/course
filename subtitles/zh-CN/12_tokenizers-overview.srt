1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:01,509
（介绍呼呼）
(intro whooshing)

2
00:00:01,509 --> 00:00:02,720
（笑脸拍打）
(smiley snapping)

3
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:03,930
（话语嘶哑）
(words whooshing)

4
00:00:03,930 --> 00:00:04,920
- 在接下来的几个视频中，
- In the next few videos,

5
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:06,720
我们将看一下分词器。
we'll take a look at the tokenizers.

6
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:09,240
在自然语言处理中，
In natural language processing,

7
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:12,930
我们处理的大部分数据都是原始文本。
most of the data that we handle consists of raw text.

8
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:14,280
然而，机器学习模型
However, machine learning models

9
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:17,103
无法阅读或理解原始形式的文本，
cannot read or understand text in its raw form,

10
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:20,253
他们只能使用数字。
they can only work with numbers.

11
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:23,220
所以分词器的目标
So the tokenizer's objective

12
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:25,923
将文本翻译成数字。
will be to translate the text into numbers.

13
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:30,240
这种转换有几种可能的方法，
There are several possible approaches to this conversion,

14
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:31,110
和目标
and the objective

15
00:00:31,110 --> 00:00:33,453
就是找到最有意义的表示。
is to find the most meaningful representation.

16
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:39,390
我们将看看三种不同的标记化算法。
We'll take a look at three distinct tokenization algorithms.

17
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:40,530
我们一对一比较，
We compare them one to one,

18
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:42,600
所以我们建议你看一下视频
so we recommend you take a look at the videos

19
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:44,040
按以下顺序。
in the following order.

20
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:45,390
首先，“基于单词”，
First, "Word-based,"

21
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:46,800
其次是 “基于字符”，
followed by "Character-based,"

22
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,877
最后，“基于子词”。
and finally, "Subword-based."

23
00:00:48,877 --> 00:00:51,794
（结尾嘶嘶声）
(outro whooshing)
