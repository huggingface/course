- 如何在 Hugging Face 论坛上提问？
- How to ask a question on the Hugging Face forums?

5
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:11,640
如果你有一般性问题
If you have a general question

6
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:13,110
或者正在调试你的代码，
or are looking to debug your code,

7
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:15,540
论坛是提问的地方。
the forums are the place to ask.

8
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:16,710
在这个视频中，我们将教你
In this video we will teach you

9
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:18,030
如何写出一个好问题，
how to write a good question,

10
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:20,380
以最大限度地提高你获得答案的机会。
to maximize the chances you will get an answer.

11
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:23,970
首先，登录论坛，
First things first, to login on the forums,

12
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:25,920
你需要一个 Hugging Face 帐户。
you need a Hugging Face account.

13
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,750
如果你还没有创建一个，
If you haven't created one already,

14
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:31,080
转到 hf.co 并单击注册。
go to hf.co and click sign up.

15
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:32,780
下面还有一个直接链接。
There is also a direct link below.

16
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:35,160
填写你的邮箱和密码，
Fill your email and password,

17
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:37,410
然后继续选择你的用户名的步骤
then continue the steps to pick your username

18
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:38,860
并更新头像。
and update a profile picture.

19
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:43,200
完成后，去 discuss.huggingface.co，
Once this is done, go to discuss.huggingface.co,

20
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,630
下方链接，点击登录。
link below, and click log in.

21
00:00:45,630 --> 00:00:47,033
使用与以下相同的登录信息
Use the same login information as

22
00:00:47,033 --> 00:00:48,693
Hugging Face 网站。
for the Hugging Face website.

23
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:51,300
你可以通过单击搜索论坛
You can search the forums by clicking

24
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:52,800
在放大镜上。
on the magnifying glass.

25
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:55,710
可能有人已经在某个主题中问过你的问题。
Someone may have already asked your question in a topic.

26
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:58,260
如果你发现你无法作为新用户发布新主题，
If you find you can't post a new topic as a new user,

27
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:01,290
这可能是因为反垃圾邮件过滤器。
it may be because of the antispam filters.

28
00:01:01,290 --> 00:01:03,750
确保你花一些时间阅读现有主题
Make sure you spend some time reading existing topics

29
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:05,370
停用它。
to deactivate it.

30
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:07,590
当你确定你的问题还没有被问到时，
When you're sure your question hasn't been asked yet,

31
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:09,660
单击新主题按钮。
click on the new topic button.

32
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:12,600
对于此示例，我们将使用以下代码，
For this example, we'll use the following code,

33
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:13,860
产生错误，
that produces an error,

34
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:16,660
正如我们在 “遇到错误时该怎么办” 视频中看到的那样。
as we saw in the "What to do when I get an error" video.

35
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:21,330
第一步是为我们的新主题选择一个类别。
The first step is to pick a category for our new topic.

36
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:23,790
由于我们的错误与 Transformers 库有关，
Since our error has to do with the Transformers library,

37
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:24,903
我们选择这个类别。
we pick this category.

38
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:29,880
接下来，选择一个能够很好地总结你的错误的标题。
Next, choose a title that summarizes your error well.

39
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:32,300
不要太含糊，否则用户会遇到与你相同的错误
Don't be too vague or users that get the same error you did

40
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:34,773
以后将无法找到你的主题。
in the future won't be able to find your topic.

41
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:38,370
输入完主题标题后，
Once you have finished typing your topic title,

42
00:01:38,370 --> 00:01:40,170
确保问题没有得到回答
make sure the question hasn't been answered

43
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:42,690
在 Discourse 主题中建议你。
in the topics Discourse suggests you.

44
00:01:42,690 --> 00:01:44,190
单击十字删除该窗口
Click on the cross to remove that window

45
00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:46,230
当你仔细检查时。
when you have double-checked.

46
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:49,710
这是发布错误时不应执行的操作的示例。
This is an example of what not to do when posting an error.

47
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:51,120
消息非常模糊，
The message is very vague,

48
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:53,370
所以没有人能猜出哪里出了问题
so no one else will be able to guess what went wrong

49
00:01:53,370 --> 00:01:55,623
对你来说，它标记了太多人。
for you, and it tags too many people.

50
00:01:56,490 --> 00:01:58,740
标记人，尤其是版主，
Tagging people, especially moderators,

51
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:01,470
可能会产生与你想要的相反的效果。
might have the opposite effect of what you want.

52
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:04,380
当你向他们发送通知时，他们会收到很多通知，
As you send them a notification, and they get plenty,

53
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:06,300
他们可能不会费心回复你，
they will probably not bother replying to you,

54
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:09,300
而你没有标记的用户可能会忽略这些问题，
and users you didn't tag will probably ignore the questions,

55
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:11,430
因为他们看到被标记的用户。
since they see tagged users.

56
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:13,697
仅在你完全确定时才标记用户
Only tag a user when you are completely certain

57
00:02:13,697 --> 00:02:16,097
他们是回答你问题的最佳场所。
they are the best place to answer your question.

58
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:20,370
文本要准确，如果出现错误
Be precise in your text, and if you have an error coming

59
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:22,710
从一段特定的代码，包括该代码
from a specific piece of code, include that code

60
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:24,030
在你的帖子中。
in your post.

61
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:27,210
为了确保你的帖子看起来不错，请提出你的问题
To make sure your post looks good, place your question

62
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:30,060
在像这样的三个反引号之间。
between three backticks like this.

63
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:30,990
你可以在右边查看
You can check on the right

64
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:32,943
发布后你的帖子将如何显示。
how your post will appear once posted.

65
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:35,850
如果你的问题是关于错误的，
If your question is about an error,

66
00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:38,640
最好包括完整的回溯。
it's even better to include the full traceback.

67
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:41,610
正如 “遇到错误时该怎么办” 视频中所述，
As explained in the "What to do when I get an error" video,

68
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:43,763
如果你使用的是 Colab，请展开回溯。
expand the traceback if you're on Colab.

69
00:02:44,769 --> 00:02:45,990
就像代码一样，把它
Like for the code, put it

70
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:48,300
在包含三个反引号的两行之间
between two lines containing three backticks

71
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:50,160
正确格式化。
for proper formatting.

72
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,740
我们最后的建议是记住要友善。
Our last advice is to remember to be nice.

73
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:54,540
一句 “请” 和一句 “谢谢” 将大有帮助
A "Please," and a "Thank you" will go a long way

74
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:56,490
让别人帮助你。
into getting others to help you.

75
00:02:56,490 --> 00:02:57,780
一切都做好后，
With all that done properly,

76
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:00,143
你的问题应该很快就会得到答案。
your question should get an answer pretty quickly.

77
00:03:01,293 --> 00:03:04,344
（标题嘶嘶作响）
(title whooshes)

78
00:03:04,344 --> 00:03:06,034
（标题失败）
