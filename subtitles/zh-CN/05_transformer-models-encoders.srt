00:00:00,253 --> 00:00:03,003
（介绍引人注目）
(intro striking)

2
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:07,830
- 在本视频中，我们将研究编码器架构。
- In this video, we'll study the encoder architecture.

3
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:11,070
一个流行的仅编码器架构的例子是 BURT
An example of a popular encoder only architecture is BURT

4
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:13,323
这是同类产品中最受欢迎的型号。
which is the most popular model of its kind.

5
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:16,950
让我们首先了解它是如何工作的。
Let's first start by understanding how it works.

6
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:20,910
我们将使用一个使用三个词的小例子。
We'll use a small example using three words.

7
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:23,823
我们使用这些作为输入并将它们传递给编码器。
We use these as inputs and pass them through the encoder.

8
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:28,173
我们检索每个单词的数字表示。
We retrieve a numerical representation of each word.

9
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:32,700
例如，在这里，编码器转换这三个词，
Here, for example, the encoder converts those three words,

10
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:37,350
欢迎来到纽约，在这三个数字序列中。
welcome to NYC, in these three sequences of numbers.

11
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:40,350
编码器只输出一个数字序列
The encoder outputs exactly one sequence of numbers

12
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:41,493
每个输入词。
per input word.

13
00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:44,880
这种数值表示也可以称为
This numerical representation can also be called

14
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:47,163
特征向量或特征张量。
a feature vector, or a feature tensor.

15
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:51,030
让我们深入研究这种表示。
Let's dive into this representation.

16
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:52,740
每个词包含一个向量
It contains one vector per word

17
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:54,540
这是通过编码器传递的。
that was passed through the encoder.

18
00:00:56,130 --> 00:00:58,620
这些向量中的每一个都是一个数字表示
Each of these vector is a numerical representation

19
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:00,033
有问题的词。
of the word in question.

20
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:03,300
该向量的维度被定义
The dimension of that vector is defined

21
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:05,520
通过模型的架构。
by the architecture of the model.

22
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:08,703
对于基本 BERT 模型，它是 768。
For the base BERT model, it is 768.

23
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:13,230
这些表示包含一个词的值，
These representations contain the value of a word,

24
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:15,240
但语境化。
but contextualized.

25
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:18,570
例如，归因于单词 “to” 的向量
For example, the vector attributed to the word "to"

26
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:22,290
不只是 “to” 这个词的代表。
isn't the representation of only the "to" word.

27
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:25,650
它还考虑了它周围的词
It also takes into account the words around it

28
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:27,363
我们称之为上下文。
which we call the context.

29
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:30,780
正如它在左侧上下文中所看到的那样，
As in it looks to the left context,

30
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:32,970
我们正在学习的左边的单词，
the words on the left of the one we're studying,

31
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:34,980
这里是 “欢迎” 这个词，
here the word "Welcome",

32
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:37,497
和右边的上下文，这里是 “NYC” 这个词，
and the context on the right, here the word "NYC",

33
00:01:38,348 --> 00:01:42,000
并在给定上下文的情况下输出单词的值。
and it outputs a value for the word given its context.

34
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,420
因此，它是一个上下文化的值。
It is therefore a contextualized value.

35
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:48,810
可以说 768 个值的向量
One could say that the vector of 768 values

36
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:51,993
保留文本中单词的含义。
holds the meaning of the word within the text.

37
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:56,073
由于自我注意机制，它做到了这一点。
It does this thanks to the self-attention mechanism.

38
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:00,630
自注意力机制涉及到不同的位置，
The self-attention mechanism relates to different positions,

39
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:02,850
或单个序列中的不同单词
or different words in a single sequence

40
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:06,003
为了计算该序列的表示。
in order to compute a representation of that sequence.

41
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,000
正如我们之前所见，这意味着
As we've seen before, this means that

42
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,130
一个词的结果表示
the resulting representation of a word

43
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:13,983
已被序列中的其他词影响。
has been affected by other words in the sequence.

44
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,030
我们不会在这里深入细节
We won't dive into the specifics here

45
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:19,680
这将提供一些进一步的阅读
which will offer some further readings

46
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,330
如果你想获得更好的理解
if you want to get a better understanding

47
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:22,953
在引擎盖下发生的事情。
at what happens under the hood.

48
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:27,480
那么为什么要使用编码器呢？
So why should one use and encoder?

49
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,370
编码器可用作独立模型
Encoders can be used as stand-alone models

50
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:31,263
在各种各样的任务中。
in a wide variety of tasks.

51
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:33,360
例如，伯特，
For example, BERT,

52
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,670
可以说是最著名的变压器模型，
arguably the most famous transformer model,

53
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:37,590
是一个独立的编码器模型，
is a standalone encoder model,

54
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:38,820
并且在发布时，
and at the time of release,

55
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:40,440
这将是最先进的
it'd be the state of the art

56
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:42,780
在许多序列分类任务中，
in many sequence classification tasks,

57
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:44,190
问答任务，
question answering tasks,

58
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:46,743
掩码语言建模仅举几例。
and mask language modeling to only cite of few.

59
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:50,460
这个想法是编码器非常强大
The idea is that encoders are very powerful

60
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:52,470
在提取携带载体
at extracting vectors that carry

61
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:55,350
关于序列的有意义的信息。
meaningful information about a sequence.

62
00:02:55,350 --> 00:02:57,870
然后可以在路上处理这个向量
This vector can then be handled down the road

63
00:02:57,870 --> 00:03:00,070
通过额外的神经元来理解它们。
by additional neurons to make sense of them.

64
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:02,850
让我们看一些例子
Let's take a look at some examples

65
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:04,563
编码器真正闪耀的地方。
where encoder really shine.

66
00:03:06,210 --> 00:03:09,900
首先，掩码语言建模或 MLM。
First of all, Masked Language Modeling, or MLM.

67
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:11,970
这是预测隐藏词的任务
It's the task of predicting a hidden word

68
00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:13,590
在一个单词序列中。
in a sequence of word.

69
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:15,630
在这里，例如，我们隐藏了这个词
Here, for example, we have hidden the word

70
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:17,247
在 “我的” 和 “是” 之间。
between "My" and "is".

71
00:03:18,270 --> 00:03:21,120
这是训练 BERT 的目标之一。
This is one of the objectives with which BERT was trained.

72
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:24,393
它被训练来预测序列中的隐藏单词。
It was trained to predict hidden words in a sequence.

73
00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:27,930
编码器尤其在这种情况下大放异彩
Encoders shine in this scenario in particular

74
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:31,140
因为双向信息在这里至关重要。
as bi-directional information is crucial here.

75
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:32,947
如果我们没有右边的话，
If we didn't have the words on the right,

76
00:03:32,947 --> 00:03:34,650
“是”、“Sylvain” 和 “.”，
"is", "Sylvain" and the ".",

77
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:35,940
那么机会就很小
then there is very little chance

78
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:38,580
BERT 将能够识别名称
that BERT would have been able to identify name

79
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:40,500
作为正确的词。
as the correct word.

80
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,270
编码器需要有很好的理解
The encoder needs to have a good understanding

81
00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:45,360
序列以预测掩码词
of the sequence in order to predict a masked word

82
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:48,840
即使文本在语法上是正确的，
as even if the text is grammatically correct,

83
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:50,610
它不一定有意义
it does not necessarily make sense

84
00:03:50,610 --> 00:03:52,413
在序列的上下文中。
in the context of the sequence.

85
00:03:55,230 --> 00:03:56,580
如前面提到的，
As mentioned earlier,

86
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:59,520
编码器擅长做序列分类。
encoders are good at doing sequence classification.

87
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:02,883
情感分析是序列分类的一个例子。
Sentiment analysis is an example of sequence classification.

88
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:09,410
该模型的目的是识别序列的情绪。
The model's aim is to identify the sentiment of a sequence.

89
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:11,280
它的范围可以从给出一个序列，
It can range from giving a sequence,

90
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,960
从一颗星到五颗星的评级
a rating from one to five stars

91
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:15,900
如果进行评论分析以给予肯定，
if doing review analysis to giving a positive,

92
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:17,820
或对序列的负面评价
or negative rating to a sequence

93
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:19,220
这就是这里显示的内容。
which is what is shown here.

94
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:22,950
例如，在这里，给定两个序列，
For example, here, given the two sequences,

95
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:25,860
我们使用模型来计算预测，
we use the model to compute a prediction,

96
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:27,420
并对序列进行分类
and to classify the sequences

97
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:30,393
在这两个类别中，正面和负面。
among these two classes, positive and negative.

98
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:33,450
虽然这两个序列非常相似
While the two sequences are very similar

99
00:04:33,450 --> 00:04:35,220
包含相同的词，
containing the same words,

100
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:37,170
意义完全不同，
the meaning is entirely different,

101
00:04:37,170 --> 00:04:40,143
并且编码器模型能够掌握这种差异。
and the encoder model is able to grasp that difference.

102
00:04:41,404 --> 00:04:44,154
（结尾引人注目）
