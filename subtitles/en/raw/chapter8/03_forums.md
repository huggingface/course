How to ask a question on the Hugging Face forums?

If you have a general question or are looking to debug your code, the forums are the place to ask. In this video we will teach you how to write a good question, to maximize the chances you will get an answer.

First things first, to login on the forums, you need a Hugging Face account. If you haven't created one yet, go to hf.co and click Sign Up. There is also a direct link below.

Fill your email and password, then continue the steps ot pick a username and update a profile picture.

Once this is done, go to discuss.huggingface.co (linked below) and click Log In. Use the same login information as for the Hugging Face website.

You can search the forums by clicking on the magnifying glass. Someone may have already asked your question in a topic! If you find you can't post a new topic as a new user, it may be because of the antispam filters. Make sure you spend some time reading existing topics to deactivate it.

When you are sure your question hasn't been asked yet, click on the New Topic button.

For this example, we will use the following code,

that produces an error, as we saw in the "What to do when I get an error?" video.

The first step is to pick a category for our new topic. Since our error has to do with the Transformers library, we pick this category. New, choose a title that summarizes your error well. Don't be too vague or users that get the same error you did in the future won't be able to find your topic. Once you have finished typing your topic, make sure the question hasn't been answered in the topics Discourse suggests you. Click on the cross to remove that window when you have double-checked. This is an example of what not to do when posting an error: the message is very vague so no one else will be able to guess what went wrong for you, and it tags too many people. Tagging people (especially moderators) might have the opposite effect of what you want. As you send them a notification (and they get plenty), they will probably not bother replying to you, and users you didn't tag will probably ignore the question since they see tagged users. Only tag a user when you are completely certain they are the best placed to answer your question. Be precise in your text, and if you have an error coming from a specific piece of code, include that code in your post. To make sure your post looks good, place your question between three backticks like this. You can check on the right how your post will appear once posted. If your question is about an error, it's even better to include the full traceback. As explained in the "what to do when I get an error?' video, expand the traceback if you are on Colab. like for the code, put it between two lines containing three backticks for proper formatting. Our last advice is to remember to be nice, a please and a thank you will go a long way into getting others to help you. With all that done properly, your question should get an answer pretty quickly!
