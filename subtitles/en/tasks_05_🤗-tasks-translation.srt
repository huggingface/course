Welcome to the Hugging Face tasks series.

2
00:00:07,529 --> 00:00:11,840
In this video, we will take a look at the
Translation task.

3
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:19,420
Translation is the task of translating text
from one language to another.

4
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:24,420
These models take a text in the source language
and output the translation of that text in

5
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:28,609
the target language.

6
00:00:28,609 --> 00:00:31,619
The task is evaluated on the BLEU score.

7
00:00:31,619 --> 00:00:38,430
The score ranges from 0 to 1, in which 1 means
the translation perfectly matched and 0 did

8
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:40,110
not match at all.

9
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:45,320
BLEU is calculated over subsequent tokens
called n-grams.

10
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:51,629
Unigram refers to a single token while bi-gram
refers to token pairs and n-grams refer to

11
00:00:51,629 --> 00:00:56,219
n subsequent tokens.

12
00:00:56,219 --> 00:01:01,859
Machine translation datasets contain pairs
of text in a language and translation of the

13
00:01:01,859 --> 00:01:05,910
text in another language.

14
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:11,290
These models can help you build conversational
agents across different languages.

15
00:01:11,290 --> 00:01:16,110
One option is to translate the training data
used for the chatbot and train a separate

16
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:19,970
chatbot.

17
00:01:19,970 --> 00:01:24,950
You can put one translation model from your
user’s language to the language your chatbot

18
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:31,360
is trained on, translate the user inputs and
do intent classification, take the output

19
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:39,399
of the chatbot and translate it from the language
your chatbot was trained on to the user’s

20
00:01:39,399 --> 00:01:40,850
language.

21
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:49,720
