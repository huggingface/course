00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:10,480
Welcome to the Hugging Face Course! This 
course has been designed to teach you all  

2
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:15,200
about the Hugging Face ecosystem: how to 
use the dataset and model hub as well as  

3
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:20,880
all our open source libraries. Here is 
the Table of Contents. As you can see,  

4
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:26,000
it's divided in three sections which become 
progressively more advanced. At this stage,  

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,560
the first two sections have been released. The 
first will teach you the basics of how to use  

6
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:35,680
a Transformer model, fine-tune it on your own 
dataset and share the result with the community.  

7
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:42,400
The second will dive deeper into our libraries 
and teach you how to tackle any NLP task. We are  

8
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:46,960
actively working on the last one and hope to 
have it ready for you for the spring of 2022.  

9
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:52,320
The first chapter requires no technical knowledge 
and is a good introduction to learn what  

10
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:59,040
Transformers models can do and how they could be 
of use to you or your company. The next chapters  

11
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:03,280
require a good knowledge of Python and some basic 
knowledge of Machine Learning and Deep Learning.  

12
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:09,120
If you don't know what a training and validation 
set is or what gradient descent means,  

13
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:13,600
you should look at an introductory course such as 
the ones published by deeplearning.ai or fast.ai.  

14
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,400
It's also best if you have some basics in one 
Deep Learning Framework (PyTorch or TensorFlow).  

15
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:25,280
Each part of the material introduced in this 
course has a version in both those frameworks,  

16
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:30,160
so you will be able to pick the one you are 
most comfortable with. This is the team that  

17
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:34,240
developed this course. I'll now let each of 
the speakers introduce themselves briefly.
