00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:11,760
In this video we'll take a look at how you 
upload your very own dataset to the Hub.  

2
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:16,560
The first you'll need to do is create 
a new dataset repository on the Hub.  

3
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:20,480
Just click on your profile icon and 
select the "New Dataset" button.  

4
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:26,720
Next we need to assign an owner of the dataset. 
By default, this will be your Hub account,  

5
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:29,840
but you can also create datasets under 
any organisation that you belong to.  

6
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:36,160
Then we just need to give the dataset a name and 
specify whether it is a public or private dataset.  

7
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:41,520
Public datasets can be accessed by anyone, 
while private datasets can only be accessed  

8
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:46,800
by you or members of your organisation. And with 
that we can go ahead and create the dataset!  

9
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:52,800
Now that you have an empty dataset repository on 
the Hub, the next thing to do is add some data  

10
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:59,360
to it! You can do this with Git, but the easiest 
way is by selecting "Upload file" and uploading  

11
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:04,880
the files directly from your machine. After you've 
uploaded the files, you'll see them appear in the  

12
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:11,360
repository under the "Files and versions" tab. 
The last step is to create a dataset card. Well  

13
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:14,160
documented datasets are more likely to be useful 
to others (including your future self!) as they  

14
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:18,400
provide the context to decide whether the dataset 
is relevant or whether there are any biases or  

15
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:23,680
risks associated with using the dataset. On the 
Hugging Face Hub, this information is stored in  

16
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:29,440
each repository’s README.md file and there are 
two main steps you should take. First you need  

17
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:33,360
to create some metadata that will allow your 
dataset to be easily found by others on the Hub.  

18
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:38,560
You can create this metadata using the Datasets 
Tagging Application which we'll link to in the  

19
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:43,040
video description. Once you have created the 
metadata, you can fill out the rest of the  

20
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:49,200
dataset card and we provide a template that is 
also linked in the video. And once your dataset  

21
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:53,680
is up on the Hub, you can load it using the 
trusty load_dataset() function! Just provide  

22
00:01:53,680 --> 00:02:04,000
the name of your repository and a data_files 
argument for the files and you're good to go!
