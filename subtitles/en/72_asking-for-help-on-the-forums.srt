How to ask a question on the Hugging Face forums?

2
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:15,360
If you have a general question or are looking to 
debug your code, the forums are the place to ask.  

3
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:17,760
In this video we will teach you 
how to write a good question,  

4
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:20,080
to maximize the chances you will get an answer.

5
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:25,120
First things first, to login on the 
forums, you need a Hugging Face account.  

6
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:32,560
If you haven't created one yet, go to hf.co and 
click Sign Up. There is also a direct link below.

7
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:34,880
Fill your email and password,  

8
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:38,480
then continue the steps ot pick a 
username and update a profile picture.

9
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:43,040
Once this is done, go to discuss.huggingface.co  

10
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:48,480
(linked below) and click Log In. Use the same 
login information as for the Hugging Face website.

11
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:53,840
You can search the forums by clicking on the 
magnifying glass. Someone may have already asked  

12
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:59,040
your question in a topic! If you find you can't 
post a new topic as a new user, it may be because  

13
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:04,480
of the antispam filters. Make sure you spend some 
time reading existing topics to deactivate it.

14
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:09,440
When you are sure your question hasn't been 
asked yet, click on the New Topic button.

15
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:11,840
For this example, we will use the following code,

16
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:16,320
that produces an error, as we saw in the 
"What to do when I get an error?" video.

17
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:22,400
The first step is to pick a category for our 
new topic. Since our error has to do with the  

18
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:29,040
Transformers library, we pick this category. New, 
choose a title that summarizes your error well.  

19
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:33,040
Don't be too vague or users that get 
the same error you did in the future  

20
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:37,600
won't be able to find your topic. Once 
you have finished typing your topic,  

21
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:41,680
make sure the question hasn't been answered 
in the topics Discourse suggests you.  

22
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:44,960
Click on the cross to remove that 
window when you have double-checked.  

23
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,880
This is an example of what not to do when 
posting an error: the message is very vague  

24
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:55,120
so no one else will be able to guess what went 
wrong for you, and it tags too many people.  

25
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:00,560
Tagging people (especially moderators) might 
have the opposite effect of what you want.  

26
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:05,520
As you send them a notification (and they get 
plenty), they will probably not bother replying  

27
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:10,480
to you, and users you didn't tag will probably 
ignore the question since they see tagged users.  

28
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:15,520
Only tag a user when you are completely certain 
they are the best placed to answer your question.  

29
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:21,760
Be precise in your text, and if you have an 
error coming from a specific piece of code,  

30
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:27,760
include that code in your post. To make sure your 
post looks good, place your question between three  

31
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:32,720
backticks like this. You can check on the 
right how your post will appear once posted.  

32
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:39,040
If your question is about an error, it's even 
better to include the full traceback. As explained  

33
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:44,560
in the "what to do when I get an error?' video, 
expand the traceback if you are on Colab. like  

34
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:50,320
for the code, put it between two lines containing 
three backticks for proper formatting. Our last  

35
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:55,120
advice is to remember to be nice, a please and a 
thank you will go a long way into getting others  

36
00:02:55,120 --> 00:03:03,840
to help you. With all that done properly, your 
question should get an answer pretty quickly!
