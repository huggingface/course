- How to ask a question on
the Hugging Face forums?

5
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:11,640
If you have a general question

6
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:13,110
or are looking to debug your code,

7
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:15,540
the forums are the place to ask.

8
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:16,710
In this video we will teach you

9
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:18,030
how to write a good question,

10
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:20,380
to maximize the chances
you will get an answer.

11
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:23,970
First things first, to
login on the forums,

12
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:25,920
you need a Hugging Face account.

13
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,750
If you haven't created one already,

14
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:31,080
go to hf.co and click sign up.

15
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:32,780
There is also a direct link below.

16
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:35,160
Fill your email and password,

17
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:37,410
then continue the steps
to pick your username

18
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:38,860
and update a profile picture.

19
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:43,200
Once this is done, go to
discuss.huggingface.co,

20
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,630
link below, and click log in.

21
00:00:45,630 --> 00:00:47,033
Use the same login information as

22
00:00:47,033 --> 00:00:48,693
for the Hugging Face website.

23
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:51,300
You can search the forums by clicking

24
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:52,800
on the magnifying glass.

25
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:55,710
Someone may have already asked
your question in a topic.

26
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:58,260
If you find you can't post
a new topic as a new user,

27
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:01,290
it may be because of the antispam filters.

28
00:01:01,290 --> 00:01:03,750
Make sure you spend some
time reading existing topics

29
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:05,370
to deactivate it.

30
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:07,590
When you're sure your question
hasn't been asked yet,

31
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:09,660
click on the new topic button.

32
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:12,600
For this example, we'll
use the following code,

33
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:13,860
that produces an error,

34
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:16,660
as we saw in the "What to do
when I get an error" video.

35
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:21,330
The first step is to pick a
category for our new topic.

36
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:23,790
Since our error has to do
with the Transformers library,

37
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:24,903
we pick this category.

38
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:29,880
Next, choose a title that
summarizes your error well.

39
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:32,300
Don't be too vague or users
that get the same error you did

40
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:34,773
in the future won't be
able to find your topic.

41
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:38,370
Once you have finished
typing your topic title,

42
00:01:38,370 --> 00:01:40,170
make sure the question
hasn't been answered

43
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:42,690
in the topics Discourse suggests you.

44
00:01:42,690 --> 00:01:44,190
Click on the cross to remove that window

45
00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:46,230
when you have double-checked.

46
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:49,710
This is an example of what not
to do when posting an error.

47
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:51,120
The message is very vague,

48
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:53,370
so no one else will be able
to guess what went wrong

49
00:01:53,370 --> 00:01:55,623
for you, and it tags too many people.

50
00:01:56,490 --> 00:01:58,740
Tagging people, especially moderators,

51
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:01,470
might have the opposite
effect of what you want.

52
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:04,380
As you send them a notification,
and they get plenty,

53
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:06,300
they will probably not
bother replying to you,

54
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:09,300
and users you didn't tag will
probably ignore the questions,

55
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:11,430
since they see tagged users.

56
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:13,697
Only tag a user when you
are completely certain

57
00:02:13,697 --> 00:02:16,097
they are the best place
to answer your question.

58
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:20,370
Be precise in your text, and
if you have an error coming

59
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:22,710
from a specific piece of
code, include that code

60
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:24,030
in your post.

61
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:27,210
To make sure your post looks
good, place your question

62
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:30,060
between three backticks like this.

63
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:30,990
You can check on the right

64
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:32,943
how your post will appear once posted.

65
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:35,850
If your question is about an error,

66
00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:38,640
it's even better to
include the full traceback.

67
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:41,610
As explained in the "What to
do when I get an error" video,

68
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:43,763
expand the traceback if you're on Colab.

69
00:02:44,769 --> 00:02:45,990
Like for the code, put it

70
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:48,300
between two lines
containing three backticks

71
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:50,160
for proper formatting.

72
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,740
Our last advice is to remember to be nice.

73
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:54,540
A "Please," and a "Thank
you" will go a long way

74
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:56,490
into getting others to help you.

75
00:02:56,490 --> 00:02:57,780
With all that done properly,

76
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:00,143
your question should get
an answer pretty quickly.
