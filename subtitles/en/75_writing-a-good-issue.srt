How to write a good issue on GitHub? GitHub 
is the main place for the Hugging Face open  

2
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:15,920
source libraries, and should always go there 
to report a bug or ask for a new feature. For  

3
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:21,680
more general questions or to debug your own code, 
use the forums (see the video linked below). It's  

4
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:25,920
very important to write good issues as it will 
help the bug you uncovered be fixed in no time.  

5
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:31,760
For this video, we have created a version of 
Transformers with a bug. You can install it by  

6
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:36,080
executing this command in a notebook (remove the 
exclamation mark to execute it in a terminal).  

7
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:43,440
In this version, the following example fails. The 
error is rather cryptic and does not seem to come  

8
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:49,600
from anything in our code, so it seems we have a 
bug to report! The first thing to do in this case  

9
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:53,200
is to try to find the smallest amount of 
code possible that reproduces the bug.  

10
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,680
In our case, inspecting the traceback, we see the 
failure happens inside the pipeline function when  

11
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:06,400
it calls AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained. Using the 
debugger, we find the values passed to that method  

12
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:11,840
and can thus create a small sample of code 
that hopefully generates the same error.  

13
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:16,800
It's very important to go though this step as you 
may realize the error was on your side and not  

14
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:21,280
a bug in the library, but it also will make it 
easier for the maintainers to fix your problem.  

15
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:24,880
Here we can play around a bit more with 
this code and notice the error happens  

16
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:31,040
for different checkpoints and not just this one, 
and that it disappears when we use use_fast=False  

17
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:36,400
inside our tokenizer call. The important part 
is to have something that does not depend on any  

18
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:42,800
external files or data. Try to replace your data 
by fake values if you can't share it. With all  

19
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:48,480
of this done, we are ready to start writing our 
issue. Click on the button next to Bug Report and  

20
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:54,160
you will discover there is a template to fill. It 
will only take you a couple of minutes. The first  

21
00:01:54,160 --> 00:02:00,000
thing is to properly name your issue. Don't pick 
a title that is too vague! Then you have to fill  

22
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,800
your environment information. There is a command 
provided by the Transformers library to do this.  

23
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:09,840
Just execute it in your notebook or in 
a terminal, and copy paste the results.  

24
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:15,600
There are two last questions to fill manually 
(to which the answers are no and no in our case).  

25
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:23,680
Next, we need to determine who to tag. There is 
a full list of usernames. Since our issue has  

26
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:28,880
to do with tokenizers, we pick the maintainer 
associated with them. There is no point tagging  

27
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:32,640
more than 3 people, they will redirect you 
to the right person if you made a mistake.  

28
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:37,280
Next, we have to give the information 
necessary to reproduce the bug.  

29
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,280
We paste our sample, and put it between two 
lines with three backticks so it's formatted  

30
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:49,840
properly. We also paste the full traceback, still 
between two lines of three backticks. Lastly,  

31
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:54,400
we can add any additional information about 
what we tried to debug the issue at hand.  

32
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:58,800
With all of this, you should expect an answer to 
your issue pretty fast, and hopefully, a quick  

33
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:03,840
fix! Note that all the advise in this video 
applies for almost every open-source project.
